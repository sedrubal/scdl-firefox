![logo](data/icon-512.png)

The plugin is able to download music from http://www.soundcloud.com and set id3tag to the downloaded music. It will probably work only with Linux and needs the python script scdl (https://github.com/flyingrub/scdl) installed and configured. Just right click on a song link on https://soundcloud.com/ and select "Download this song". After some seconds it should appear in the download folder you configured for scdl. It is very simple and fully free and opensource: https://github.com/sedrubal/scdl-firefox
